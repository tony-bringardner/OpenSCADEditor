The Polygon Design Window will help you design 2D polygons for use in OpenSCAD.

<h2>Create a simple polygon</h2>
	
<ul>
	<li>Press and hold the "Control" key to add control points in the drawing panel on the left side of the window. New control points will be added to the end.
	<li>Adjust the control points by dragging with the mouse.
	<li>You can 'right click' a line segment to convert it to a Bézier curve segment.  Once the segment is converted you can right click the segment to add an addition control point.
	<li>Press the "Create Polygon Code" button to generate the OpenSCAD code.  The code will be placed in the bottom of the design window. 
	<li>Copy the generated code and past it into the OpenSCAD editor. 	
</ul>	

<h2>Create a polygon from an image</h2>
	
<ul>
	<li>Press the "Load Image" button.
	<li>Select the image file you want to work with.
	<li>Press the "Create Polygon Code" button to generate the OpenSCAD code.  The code will be placed in the bottom of the design window.
	<li>The right hand panel will show the image as interpreted by the design analysis.
	<li>Black and white images are best.  Images that are not black and white will be converted to grey scale then black and white.
	<li>The "Image white threshold" setting is used to determine if a grey value is black or white.
	<li>Press the "Create Polygon Code" button to generate the OpenSCAD code.  The code will be placed in the bottom of the design window.
	<li>Copy the generated code and past it into the OpenSCAD editor.
